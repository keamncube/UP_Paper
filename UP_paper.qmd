The following aggregation scheme which results in nine categories was followed based on @tbl-scheme:

a.	Non-financial corporate unsecured lending: Items 168 + 183 + 190 
b.	Household unsecured lending: Items 169 + 185 + 192   
c.	Total unsecured lending: Non-financial corporate unsecured lending + Household unsecured lending
d.	Commercial mortgages to corporates and households: Items 152 + 153 + 156 + 163 + 164   
e.  Residential mortgages to household: Item 157
f.	Total mortgage lending: Commercial mortgages to corporates and households + Residential mortgages to household
g.	Leasing and instalments to corporates: Items 142 + 147
h.  Leasing and instalments to households: Items 143 + 148
i.  Total leasing and instalments: Leasing and instalments to corporates + Leasing and instalments to households

## Bank lending rates weighting scheme (check)

The loans quantities from the BA900s are then linked to the lending rate data from the BA930s using table to create nine lending rate categories the schema on @tbl-scheme1. The weights for each category are then calculated by dividing the total value of the loans in each category by the total value of all loans in the BA900s. The weights are then used to calculate the weighted average lending rate for each month. The weighted average lending rate is calculated by multiplying the lending rate for each category by the weight for that category and then summing the results.
